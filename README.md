## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### 1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The varilables that provided a non-randmon amout of variance to the mpg are vehicle_length, ground_clearance and the intercept.

### 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No. The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

### 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes, because it provides an r-squared of 0.7149 which is significantly higher than the r-squared value of 0.3715 obtained by performing a linear regression of mpg with vehicle_length only. The other variables when analyzed independently provide even lower r-squared values.
